Title: Cost Eater
=================
-----------------

####Problem Statement:
  * It can be difficult to figure out weekly expenses, because everything
    has a different price and lifespan.

####This prototype will specialize to groceries:
  * It can be difficult to estimate weekly grocery costs and a food budget.
  * Long term, but expensive, purchases can cause spikes in spending
    and create unnecessary worry.

####Example:
  * You likely only buy spices, flour, sugar, and other staples once
    or twice a year.
  * However, items like milk and eggs are probably purchased every week.
  * See how these average out over time to a consistent weekly cost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

####Problem Solution:
  * Keep track of how long food lasts, and how much it costs, to 
    average how much money the user will spend on groceries weekly.
  * This allows for easier budgeting, and peace of mind.
